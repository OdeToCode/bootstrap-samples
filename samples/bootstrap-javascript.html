                    class="initialism">CPU</a> is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a 
                computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and 
                input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the 
                computer industry at least since the early 1960s.[2] The form, design, 
                and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, 
                but their fundamental operation remains much the same.
                In older computers, CPUs require one or more printed circuit boards. 
                With the invention of 
                the microprocessor, a CPU could be contained within a single silicon chip. 
                The first computers to use microprocessors were personal computers and 
                small workstations. Since the 1970s the microprocessor class of CPUs has 
                almost completely overtaken all other CPU implementations, to the extent 
                that even mainframe computers use one or more microprocessors. Modern 
                microprocessors are large scale integrated circuits in packages typically 
                less than four centimeters square, with hundreds of connecting pins.
                A computer can have more than one CPU; this is called multiprocessing. 
                Some microprocessors can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip; 
                those microprocessors are called multi-core processors.
                Two typical components of a CPU are the

                arithmetic and logical operations, and the control unit (CU), which extracts 
                instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.
                Not all computational systems rely on a central processing unit. An array processor or 
                vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements, with no one unit
                 considered the "center". In the distributed computing model, problems are solved 
                by a distributed interconnected set of processors.

                <div>
                    Espionage or spying involves a government or individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as it is taken for granted that it is unwelcome and, in many cases illegal and punishable by law. It is a subset of intelligence gathering—which otherwise may be conducted from public sources and using perfectly legal and ethical means. It is crucial to distinguish espionage from intelligence gathering, as the latter does not necessarily involve espionage, but often collates open-source information. When successful, however, espionage always produces intelligence.
                    Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern, however the term is generally associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies primarily for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage.
                    One of the most effective ways to gather data and information about an enemy (or potential enemy) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can bring back all sorts of information concerning the size and strength of an enemy army. They can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect. In times of crisis, spies can also be used to steal technology and to sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence operatives can feed false information to enemy spies, protecting important domestic secrets and preventing attempts at subversion. Nearly every country has very strict laws concerning espionage, and the penalty for being caught is often severe. However, the benefits that can be gained through espionage are generally great enough that most governments and many large corporations make use of it to varying degrees.
                    Further information on clandestine HUMINT (human intelligence) information collection techniques is available, including discussions of operational techniques, asset recruiting and the tradecraft used to collect this information.

                    <p>programming language is an artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.</p> 
                    <p>The earliest programming languages predate the invention of the computer, and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos[citation needed]. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, with many being created every year. Most programming languages describe computation in an imperative style, i.e., as a sequence of commands, although some languages, such as those that support functional programming or logic programming, use alternative forms of description.</p>
                    <p>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard), while other languages, such as Perl 5 and earlier, have a dominant implementation that is used as a reference.</p>
                    <p>The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.[20] However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.[21] In this vein, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.[22] Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.[23] John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.[24]</p>
                    <p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.[1] Some, but not all, authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.[1][2] Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming includes...</p>
